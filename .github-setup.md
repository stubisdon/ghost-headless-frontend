# GitHub Repository Setup

Your code has been committed locally. Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

## Option 1: Create Repo via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/new
2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Repository name: `ghost-headless-frontend` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "Immersive black screen frontend for Ghost CMS"
   - Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/stub/coding/ghost-headless-frontend-starter
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ghost-headless-frontend.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Create Repo via GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
cd /Users/stub/coding/ghost-headless-frontend-starter
gh repo create ghost-headless-frontend --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## After Pushing

Your code will be on GitHub! You can:
- Share the repository URL
- Set up GitHub Actions for deployment
- Collaborate with others
